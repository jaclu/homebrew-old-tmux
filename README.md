# Jaclu Old-tmux

Since tmux 3.6 is giving me some issues, I created a tap that instead install 3.5a

## How do I install tmux 3.5a?

```shell
brew tap jaclu/old-tmux https://github.com/jaclu/homebrew-old-tmux
brew install jaclu/old-tmux/tmux@3.5a
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
